## About

I'm Adrian Labb√©, an iOS developer. I have some apps on the App Store, all open source. I try to make iOS better for coding. I'm from Switzerland but I actually live in Chile.

## My story as a developer

Firstly, I started coding iOS apps with Swift. Then, I did some HTML, CSS and JavaScript and after that I coded some games with Unity. In 2017, I started coding real projects. I coded a file manager for iOS, just before the release of iOS 11 and Files app. That would be my first app to be in the App Store, but I got lots of rejections by Apple, and with the release of the Files app in June 2017, I decided to stop this project. The file manager contained a very little SSH file browser, so I knew a bit about an SSH library for iOS. I took advantage of this knowledge for a new app for coding Swift and running the code on a SSH server. I took advantage of the iOS 11 Document Browser to store scripts. Apple rejected my app many times and I decided to cancel the project. Then, I had another idea. An app for coding any language in the user's SSH server. I started an SSH and SFTP client. That's how in January, my first app, Pisth was approved for the App Store. I continued improving the app. I was interested in starting a new app for coding on iOS devices and I learned that Python had an API to be embedded in programs. I started a terminal app but I coded every command and I added a `python` command, that I also coded myself with the Python API. I cancelled the project because my method of re-coding existing commands was very ineficient. But I started a Python IDE, Pyto. I didn't know so much about Python and this project allowed me to learn a lot about Python. In September 2018, I started getting paid for doing what I love to do, coding. After that, I started other new projects, including the terminal that I re-coded but with other's people code to focuse on the UI.
