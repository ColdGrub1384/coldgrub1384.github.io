## About Me

I'm Adrian LabbÃ©, an iOS & iPadOS developer and I write the most buggy apps of the App Store. I'm from Switzerland but I actually live in Chile. I have some apps on the App Store, all open source (except one ðŸ™ƒ). I try to make iOS better for coding.

My main project is [Pyto](https://pyto.app), an iOS app to code and run Python.

Installing programming languages or developer tools on a computer can be so easy, but it's not with the iOS sandbox. Indeed, like 99% of my emails are sandbox problems with [Pyto](https://pyto.app). No you cannot access every directory and no you cannot do `pip install tensorflow` or `pip install my_very_big_library_with_a_lot_of_c_and_fortran_extensions`.

Also, the fact that I know how to compile `pandas` or `statsmodels` for iOS and place everything in a certain form that Apple can approve it doesn't mean I know how to create a `DataFrame`. I code Python since I started coding Pyto, so I use it for iOS development and not for data science, or front-end development for example. Yeah, I'm a Python iOS Developer, I live in 2057.
